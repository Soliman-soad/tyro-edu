                <h1 className=' dark:text-white text-xl font-bold uppercase'> what is cors?</h1>
                <p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy. However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery </p>

                <h1 className=' dark:text-white text-xl font-bold uppercase'>What is Node? How does Node work?</h1>
                <p> Node.js uses the “Single Threaded Event Loop” architecture to handle multiple clients at the same time.In a multi-threaded request-response model, multiple clients send a request, and the server processes each one before sending the response back. However, multiple threads are used to process concurrent calls. These threads are defined in a thread pool, and each time a request comes in, an individual thread is assigned to handle it.</p>
